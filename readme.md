# Air Quality Development and Model Selection

The outcome of this project can be seen at [airquality.sneezingtrees.com](http://airquality.sneezingtrees.com) -
an online tool for predicting air quality in Montpellier. I recommend you start there as most of the background and explanatory information is available there.

This is one of two repositories that go hand in hand:
- Air Quality Development and Selection (where you are now) - contains all work done to develop and select a machine learning model for predicting the concentrations of the five pollutants used to measure European Air Quality.
- [Air Quality Prediction Application](https://github.com/jlad26/air-quality-prediction) - the code for the web application at [airquality.sneezingtrees.com](http://airquality.sneezingtrees.com)
